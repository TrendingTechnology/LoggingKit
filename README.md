LoggingKit is a micro framework for logging in which uses `os_log` under the hood. 
</p>

## Features

- [x] Uses `os_log` under the hood
- [x] `Combine` ready

## Example

The example application is the best way to see `LoggingKit` in action. Simply open the `LoggingKit.xcodeproj` and run the `Example` scheme. 

After the application has started you should see several log messages in your Xcode terminal and the `Console.app` for the device you ran the app on.

## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate LoggingKit into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "alexanderwe/LoggingKit"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `LoggingKit.framework` into your Xcode project. 

On your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù settings tab, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and choose ‚ÄúNew Run Script Phase‚Äù and add the Framework path as mentioned in [Carthage Getting started Step 4, 5 and 6](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos)

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/alexanderwe/LoggingKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Alternatively navigate to your Xcode project, select `Swift Packages` and click the `+` icon to search for `LoggingKit`.

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate LoggingKit into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.

## Usage


At first it makes sense to create an extensions on `LogCategories` to define your own categories. 

```swift
import LoggingKit

extension LogCategories {
    public var viewControllers: LogCategory { return .init("viewControllers") }
    public var networking: LogCategory { return .init("networking") }
    ...
}
```

After that Simply import `LoggingKit` in the files you want to use the logging methods and use them accordingly 

```swift
import LoggingKit 

logger.debug("Hello Debug", logCategory: \.viewControllers)
logger.info("Hello Info", logCategory: \.viewControllers)
logger.fault("Hello Fault", logCategory: \.viewControllers)
logger.error("Hello Error", logCategory: \.viewControllers)

```

### Combine 

If you are using combine `LoggingKit` offers some extensions on the `Publisher` type to log `Self.Output` and `Self.Failure`. 

```swift
import LoggingKit 

// logs `Self.Output`
myPublisher.logValue(logType: .info) {
    "My Value is \($0)"
}

// logs `Self.Failure`
myPublisher.logError(logCategory: \.combine) {
    "My Error is \($0)"
}

// logs `Self.Output` as well as `Self.Failure`
myPublisher.log()
```


### Console App

Now can open `Console.App` on your mac, select the device from which you want to view the log messages.
